# üß† Intelligence

A secure, multi-user chat application built with **LeafPHP**, powered by **OpenAI GPT**. Users can register/login, chat with GPT-4.1 securely, and view full encrypted chat history and usage analytics.

---

##  Features

-  JWT-based Authentication (via HTTP-only cookies)
-  Encrypted Message Storage (Eloquent mutators)
-  Chat with GPT-3.5 (OpenAI API)
-  Real-Time Usage Analytics (daily history, token breakdowns)
-  Interactive Dashboard with Chart.js
-  Secure REST API endpoints (user-specific access only)
-  Designed for multi-user, scalable architecture

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Backend:** LeafPHP (w/ Illuminate Eloquent), OpenAI API
- **Auth:** JWT RS256 with token refresh
- **Frontend:** HTML + Bootstrap + AlpineJS + Chart.js
- **Database:** MySQL or MariaDB (with JSON & encryption support)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment instructions

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pasindu-Dissanayaka/intellgence.git
cd intellgence
composer install
```

---

### 2. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
APP_ENV=production
APP_KEY=base64:GENERATED_KEY

# OpenAI Key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
MESSAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY==add-aes-256-cbc-key-here

# DB Config
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=DB_NAME
DB_USERNAME=DB_USERNAME
DB_PASSWORD=DB_PASSWORD
```
---

### 3. Generate and Rotate RS256 JWT Keys

To use RS256 for JWT signing:

```bash
mkdir -p storage/jwt

# Generate private key
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out storage/jwt/private.key -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048

# Extract public key
openssl rsa -pubout -in storage/jwt/private.key -out storage/jwt/public.key
```

---

### 4. Generate an AES-256-CBC key

To use AES-256 for Message Encryption:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```
Copy the above output into your ENV file
Or use the one in the sample for a demo

DO NOT USE THAT KEY IN PROD EITHER (-_-)

---

### 5.  Migrate the Database

```bash
php leaf db:migrate
```

---

### 6. üì° Serve the App (Dev)

```bash
php leaf serve
```

Or configure your **web server (Nginx/Apache)** to point to the `/public` directory.
