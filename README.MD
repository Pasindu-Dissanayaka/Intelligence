## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment instructions

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pasindu-Dissanayaka/intellgence.git
cd intellgence
composer install
```

---

### 2. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
APP_ENV=production
APP_KEY=base64:GENERATED_KEY

# OpenAI Key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

# JWT Config (RS256)
JWT_ALGO=RS256
JWT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=storage/jwt/private.key
JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH=storage/jwt/public.key

# DB Config
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=leaf_gpt
DB_USERNAME=youruser
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
```
---

### 3. Generate and Rotate RS256 JWT Keys

To use RS256 for JWT signing:

```bash
mkdir -p storage/jwt

# Generate private key
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out storage/jwt/private.key -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048

# Extract public key
openssl rsa -pubout -in storage/jwt/private.key -out storage/jwt/public.key
```

---

### 4.  Migrate the Database

```bash
php leaf db:migrate
```

---

### 5. üì° Serve the App (Dev)

```bash
php leaf serve
```

Or configure your **web server (Nginx/Apache)** to point to the `/public` directory.
